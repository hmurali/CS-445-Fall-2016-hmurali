A list of challenges I faced while working on this assignment and the solutions I found to those challenges:
- The biggest challenge I faced while working on this assignment was figuring out how to implement the search entity 
as per the requirements of the project API. 
- solution to this challenge: I used the hints provided by the json implementation and test case to solve this challenge.
- Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to translate the test cases to java code for each entity listed in the project API.
- solution to this challenge: First, I made sense of what sample json inputs and outputs for each entity. Then, I used that 
knoledge to translate the logic into java code. Finally, I cracked the challenge while writing code, because the implementation of each entity started 
to make sense.
